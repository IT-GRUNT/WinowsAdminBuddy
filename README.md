A small open source utility to help admins enable/disable windows settings and features.
I'm trying not to have many dependencies. Something that can be easily thrown on a USB.

Current features:

• Block MS telemetry (via host file entry) - Credits to EncryptThePlanet
• Disable search highlights (Windows 11)
• Disable Bing search from the start menu
• Block VBS, VBE, and any other scripting languages that rely on wscript
• Disable TPM 2.0 requirement
• Shortcuts for user groups (lusrmgr) and services
